- ⚡ Fun fact: Your brain burns 400-500 calories a day. That’s about a fifth of your total energy requirements.
                Most of this is concerned with the largely automatic process of controlling your muscles and processing sensory input,
                 although some studies show solving tricky problems increases your brain's metabolic requirements too.(So... go Algorithms)
